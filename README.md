# Student Info App

## Description
This project was submitted as the requirement for passing the course [Belajar Membuat Aplikasi Android dengan Jetpack Compose](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/445) on Dicoding. The theme was inspired by students of Thors Military Acedemy's Class VII from Trails of Cold Steel.


## Features
This app allows users to browse a list of students and their additional information. This application has a few additional features, such as:
- Search Bar that updates the list of students in real-time

## Technical Aspect
This project is to showcase my understanding of Android's new way of layouting, Jetpack Compose. Below are some of the components I used to build this app:
- @Composable functions: Core building blocks for UI, such as DetailScreen and HomeScreen.
- Box, Column: Layout containers for stacking elements either vertically (Column) or by layer (Box).
- Image and AsyncImage: For static and dynamic image loading.
- Text: Displays text elements across the app.
- Icon: Used for embedding interactive icons.
- Divider: Separates UI components visually.
- Surface: Material Design container for UI elements.
- LazyColumn and items: For efficient scrolling lists.
- NavigationBar and NavigationBarItem: Bottom navigation components.
- Navigation components (NavHost, composable, rememberNavController): Manages navigation within the app.
